Inspiration: https://medium.com/@dprakash05/twitter-sentiment-analysis-f81f3d24c795

The objective here is to analyse the tweets using Twitter API.

The goal is to identify individual tweets as positive, negative and neutral and to calculate the percentage of positive and negative tweets. The goal is to analyse tweets of a politician Alex Stubb and calculate the percentage of positive and negative tweets.

The difference between polarity and subjective is that polarity is a float which lies in the range of [-1,1] where 1 means positive statement and -1 means a negative statement. The polarity indicates sentiment with a value from -1.0 (negative) to 1.0 (positive) with 0.0 being neutral.

Subjective sentences generally refer to personal opinion, emotion or judgment whereas objective refers to factual information. Subjectivity is also a float which lies in the range of [0,1]. The subjectivity is a value from 0.0 (objective) to 1.0 (subjective).
